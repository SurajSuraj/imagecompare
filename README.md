# imagecompare
This project compares two jpeg images according to the image links that we provide and returns the comparison value in a scale from 0 to 100(0 for completely different and 100 for exactly similar).We also do not store the images offline.The project only compares images in the jpg format and the comparison is done pixelwise instead of histogram and other packages.The gd library in php is used for the working of the project.
